# Hey Classification GUI - Tab Reorganization

## Changes Made

The Hey Classification GUI has been reorganized to prioritize the improved classifier:

### New Tab Order:
1. **üöÄ Hey Classifier (Primary)** - The improved classification system (was tab 4, now tab 1)
2. **Database Editor** - For editing and managing classifications (was tab 3, now tab 2)  
3. **Analysis** - Analysis tools and reports (was tab 2, now tab 3)
4. **‚öôÔ∏è Legacy Setup** - Original setup tool (was tab 1, now tab 4)

### Key Improvements:

#### Primary Tab (Improved Classifier):
- Now opens by default as the first tab
- Added prominent header with description
- Shows "62.5% accuracy improvement" information
- Contains all the advanced classification features:
  - Single mineral testing
  - Batch processing
  - Validation and comparison tools

#### Legacy Setup Tab:
- Moved to last position
- Added deprecation warning
- Guides users to use the primary tab instead
- Still available for backward compatibility

#### Tab Enabling Logic:
- Improved classifier tab is always enabled (primary functionality)
- Other tabs are enabled when data is available
- Better user experience with immediate access to main features

### Benefits:
1. **Better User Experience**: Users immediately see the best classification tool
2. **Improved Workflow**: Primary functionality is front and center
3. **Clear Guidance**: Deprecation notices guide users to better tools
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy tools still available when needed

### Usage:
- Start with the primary "üöÄ Hey Classifier (Primary)" tab
- Use single mineral testing to verify classifications
- Process batches with the improved algorithm
- Use validation tools to compare results
- Only use Legacy Setup if specifically needed for old workflows
