# Edge Effects Filtering Fix for Data Acquisition Interruptions

## üö® **Problem Identified**

User correctly identified a **data acquisition interruption issue** where:
- **Map visualization** showed an incomplete line at Y=57
- **PCA/NMF components** appeared far from main clusters
- **Diagnostic tool revealed** 263 missing spectra ALL at Y=57 (X positions 24-286)
- **Root cause**: Data output process was terminated by unknown error during scanning

## üîç **Real-World Root Cause**

### **Data Acquisition Interruption**:
- **Scenario**: Automated scanning system collecting Raman map data
- **Interruption**: Data storing process terminated during Y=57 line acquisition
- **Result**: Scan line Y=57 truncated at X=24, remaining positions never saved
- **Common causes**: Power issues, software crashes, hardware failures, storage problems

### **Impact Pattern**:
- **Expected**: 16,646 total positions  
- **Loaded**: 16,383 spectra
- **Missing**: 263 spectra (Y=57 truncated from X=24 to X=286)
- **Type**: Classic "truncated line" - acquisition stopped mid-scan

### **Analysis Impact**:
1. **Map visualization**: Shows gaps at Y=57 (filled with NaN) ‚úÖ Correct behavior
2. **PCA/NMF analysis**: Includes remaining 16,383 spectra, but truncated Y=57 creates **artificial spatial discontinuity**
3. **Edge effects**: Spectra at Y=56 and Y=58 now appear as outliers (missing spatial neighbors)
4. **Variance capture**: PCA/NMF components capture the discontinuity as major variance source

## üõ†Ô∏è **Enhanced Solution**

### **1. Intelligent Incomplete Line Detection**
```python
def diagnose_data_consistency(self):
    """Enhanced diagnostic with scan line completeness analysis."""
    # Analyze each scan line for completeness
    for y_pos in self.map_data.y_positions:
        spectra_in_line = 0
        missing_positions = []
        
        for x_pos in self.map_data.x_positions:
            if self.map_data.get_spectrum(x_pos, y_pos) is not None:
                spectra_in_line += 1
            else:
                missing_positions.append(x_pos)
        
        # Classify line type
        if spectra_in_line == 0:
            line_type = 'completely_missing'
        elif spectra_in_line < expected_line_length:
            # Check if truncated (consecutive missing at end)
            line_type = 'truncated' if missing_positions == list(range(
                max(missing_positions), max_x + 1)) else 'partial'
        
        # Report acquisition interruptions
        if line_type == 'truncated':
            print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  DATA ACQUISITION INTERRUPTED at Y={y_pos}, X={min(missing_positions)}")
```

### **2. Smart Edge Effects Filtering**
```python
def filter_edge_effects_from_ml_data(self, y_buffer=2):
    """Filter spectra near incomplete scan lines."""
    # Identify incomplete lines (>10% missing spectra)
    for y_pos in self.map_data.y_positions:
        spectra_in_line = sum(1 for x_pos in self.map_data.x_positions 
                             if self.map_data.get_spectrum(x_pos, y_pos) is not None)
        
        if spectra_in_line < expected_line_length * 0.9:
            incomplete_y_positions.add(y_pos)
    
    # Remove spectra within buffer zone of incomplete lines
    for incomplete_y in incomplete_y_positions:
        mask = np.abs(filtered_df['y_pos'] - incomplete_y) > y_buffer
        filtered_df = filtered_df[mask]
```

### **3. User Notification System**
- **Console output**: Detailed scan line analysis with interruption points
- **Warning dialog**: User-friendly explanation of acquisition interruptions
- **Recommendations**: Automatic guidance for handling incomplete data

## üéØ **Scan Line Classification**

### **Complete Lines**:
- All expected X positions have spectra
- No data acquisition issues
- Safe for all analysis types

### **Truncated Lines** (Most Common):
- Acquisition started normally
- **Interrupted mid-scan** (like Y=57 stopping at X=24)
- Missing positions are consecutive at line end
- **Cause**: Process termination during acquisition

### **Partial Lines** (Less Common):
- Scattered missing positions throughout line
- **Cause**: Individual file save failures or corruption

### **Missing Lines** (Rare):
- No spectra in entire line
- **Cause**: Complete acquisition failure for that Y position

## üìä **Enhanced Filtering Logic**

### **Threshold-Based Detection**:
- **>90% complete**: Considered complete line
- **<90% complete**: Flagged as incomplete (edge filtering candidate)
- **Adjustable threshold**: Can be modified for different data quality standards

### **Buffer Zone Strategy**:
- **Default y_buffer=2**: Removes Y¬±2 positions around incomplete lines
- **For Y=57 truncated**: Removes spectra at Y=55, 56, 58, 59
- **Conservative approach**: Better to exclude borderline spectra than include artifacts

## üîß **User Experience**

### **Automatic Detection**:
1. **Load map data** ‚Üí System detects incomplete lines automatically
2. **Run diagnostic** ‚Üí Detailed report shows acquisition interruptions
3. **Warning dialog** ‚Üí User-friendly explanation and recommendations
4. **Filtered analysis** ‚Üí Edge effects removed by default

### **Example Output**:
```
=== SCAN LINE ANALYSIS ===
Complete scan lines: 126
Incomplete scan lines: 1

INCOMPLETE LINES DETECTED:
Y=57: TRUNCATED - 24/287 spectra (8.4%)
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  DATA ACQUISITION INTERRUPTED at X=24
  üìÅ Missing X positions: 24 to 286

‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: INCOMPLETE SCAN LINES DETECTED
   This indicates data acquisition interruptions during scanning.
   Recommendation: Enable 'Filter Edge Effects' in PCA/NMF tabs.
```

## üéØ **Expected Results**

### **With Edge Filtering (Recommended)**:
- **Removes Y=55,56,58,59**: Eliminates artificial discontinuity effects
- **Clean PCA/NMF components**: Focus on real spectral variance, not acquisition artifacts
- **Spatial consistency**: Analysis uses only complete spatial regions
- **Typical reduction**: ~16,383 ‚Üí ~15,800-16,000 spectra

### **Without Edge Filtering**:
- **Keeps all loaded spectra**: Includes edge effects from truncated lines
- **Outlier components**: PCA/NMF may capture discontinuity as major variance
- **Research use**: Useful for studying data quality or edge effects specifically

## üöÄ **Real-World Benefits**

### **For Instrument Operators**:
- **Clear feedback** on data acquisition issues
- **Quantified impact** of interruptions on analysis
- **Quality control** guidance for future scans

### **For Data Analysts**:
- **Automatic artifact removal** without manual intervention
- **Informed decisions** about data filtering
- **Reliable analysis results** despite acquisition problems

### **For Method Development**:
- **Understanding** of how acquisition interruptions affect analysis
- **Validated approach** for handling incomplete scan data
- **Reproducible filtering** across different datasets
