# Peak-Based Search Filter Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The Peak-based Search filter in the Advanced search tab was not working correctly. When users typed in peak positions (e.g., "1050, 1350, 1580"), the software searched the entire spectrum instead of filtering results to only those spectra containing peaks at the specified positions.

## Root Cause
The issue was in how peak data was stored versus how it was filtered:

1. **Storage**: When spectra were added to the database, peak data was stored as **array indices** from `scipy.signal.find_peaks()` (e.g., [50, 120, 200])
2. **Filtering**: The peak filter expected **wavenumber values** (e.g., [1050, 1350, 1580])

This mismatch meant the filtering logic was comparing wavenumber values against array indices, which never matched.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Peak Storage (Line ~1445)
```python
# Convert peak indices to wavenumber values before storing
peak_wavenumbers = None
if self.detected_peaks is not None and len(self.detected_peaks) > 0:
    # Convert indices to actual wavenumber values
    peak_wavenumbers = self.current_wavenumbers[self.detected_peaks].tolist()

success = self.raman_db.add_to_database(
    name=name_edit.text(),
    wavenumbers=self.current_wavenumbers,
    intensities=self.processed_intensities,
    metadata=metadata,
    peaks=peak_wavenumbers  # Now stores wavenumber values, not indices
)
```

### 2. Enhanced Peak Filtering Logic (Lines ~1899-1980)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Handles both legacy (indices) and new (wavenumber values) formats
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects whether stored values are indices or wavenumbers
- **Robust Conversion**: Safely converts legacy indices to wavenumbers when needed
- **Better Error Handling**: Provides detailed debug information when filtering fails

### 3. Improved User Interface
- **Clearer Instructions**: Changed placeholder text to "Comma-separated wavenumber values"
- **Important Warning**: Added note that database spectra must have detected peaks
- **Better Feedback**: Enhanced error messages and status updates during search

### 4. Enhanced Database Statistics
- **Peak Count Display**: Shows how many spectra have detected peaks
- **Filter Readiness**: Indicates whether peak-based filtering will work
- **Guidance Messages**: Provides specific advice based on database state

## How to Use the Peak Filter

### Prerequisites
1. **Load a spectrum** in the main application
2. **Detect peaks** using the Peak Detection controls in the Process tab
3. **Add the spectrum to database** with detected peaks

### Using the Filter
1. Go to **Search > Advanced Search** tab
2. In the **Peak-Based Search Filter** section:
   - Enter peak positions as comma-separated wavenumber values (e.g., "1050, 1350, 1580")
   - Set appropriate tolerance (default: ±10 cm⁻¹)
3. Click **Advanced Search**

### Expected Behavior
- Only spectra containing **ALL specified peaks** (within tolerance) will be returned
- Results are then ranked by similarity using the selected algorithm
- Clear feedback is provided if no matches are found

## Validation Steps

### To test the fix:
1. **Load and process a spectrum** with clear peaks
2. **Detect peaks** in the Process tab
3. **Add the spectrum to database** 
4. **Try peak-based search** with one of the detected peak positions
5. **Verify filtering works** - should return that spectrum in results

### Debug Information
The enhanced logging will show in the console:
- Which peaks are being searched for
- Which spectra pass/fail the peak filter
- Specific reasons for filtering failures

## Files Modified
- `raman_analysis_app_qt6.py`: Main application file with all fixes

## Backward Compatibility
The fix maintains backward compatibility with existing databases containing peak data stored as indices. Legacy data is automatically converted during filtering operations.

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding a "Migrate Peak Data" option to convert all legacy peak indices to wavenumbers
- Add visual feedback showing detected peaks on spectra in database browser
- Implement "OR" logic option (match ANY peak instead of ALL peaks)
